## Milestones

| Milestone | Status | Exit evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Engineering baseline | VERIFIED | E2E m1-baseline (isolation+IPC), 28 unit tests, packaged .app launch smoke, boundary lint | node:sqlite/node-pty/rg strategies in ADR-0003 |
| 2. Shell and persistence | VERIFIED | E2E m2-shell (restart restore), m2-db-failure (safe mode), 10 unit tests (db+settings) | |
| 3. Workspace and editor | VERIFIED | E2E-002/003 pass (m3-editor.spec), 31 unit tests (doc store/workspace/path boundary), 10k-file lazy tree integration test | Data-loss race renderer-guard documented in editorStore |
| 4. Search, LSP, terminal | VERIFIED | E2E-004..007 pass, 6 search unit tests, full E2E suite 12/12 twice | rg via system binary (ADR-0003); python LSP degrades with guidance |
| 5. Git and changes | VERIFIED | E2E-008 + non-git flow, 51 unit tests incl. 34-case rollback matrix | Full 50-case matrix expands at M12 gate run |
| 6. Pi read-only agent | VERIFIED | E2E-009/019-core/HIST-002 (4 E2E), pi adapter contract tests (no-builtin-tools), 141 unit tests total | OAuth providers deferred to API-key flow (ADR pending M12 notes) |
| 7. Tools and permissions | VERIFIED | E2E-012/013 + approve-and-run + ask_user (4 E2E green), permission engine 15 tests, classifier 17, runner 11, command tools 9, security matrix 9, SQL store 3 | R3 never granted permanently; R4 refused pre-prompt; PERM-007 param-binding enforced |
| 8. Agent editing and review | VERIFIED | E2E-010/011/014/015 all green (m8-review.spec, full suite 26/26), 25 new unit tests (review hunks 10, write tools 10, plan utils 5) | Plan approval flows through the propose_plan tool channel (works for real Pi too); write gate denies first write until plan approved (AG-007); hunk keys are content-derived so decisions fail closed on staleness |
| 9. Verification and history | VERIFIED | E2E-016/017/018 green (m9-verification.spec, full suite 29/29 twice), VerificationService 7 unit tests, rename tool test | Final report separates agent narrative from system evidence; stale/superseded semantics on verification_runs; unverified accept needs explicit confirm; rollback preflight stops on external-change conflicts |
| PIVOT. Dual-form shell (ADR-0004) | VERIFIED | pivot-shell.spec 3 E2E (PIVOT-001..009), full suite 32/32 twice, model-catalog 4 unit tests | Charter branding (no Pi in UI); Home task launcher default entry; Settings provider keys + live model fetch |
| HOME-V2 P1. Activity stream + mission control (ADR-0006) | VERIFIED | home-v2.spec 3 E2E (PIVOT-011..015), full suite 35/35 twice, activity projection 9 + notification 4 unit tests | Pure-projection activity stream (live = replay source); mission-control cards with live current action; macOS notifications on attention edges (focused-window suppressed); drag/@ context refs; clickable paths; tool lifecycle renders as one in-place card (callId dedupe) |
| HOME-V2 P2. Parallel runs + replay + glow + ⌘K (ADR-0006) | VERIFIED | p2-parallel-replay.spec 3 E2E (PIVOT-016..018), full suite 38/38 ×3 consecutively, gateway modeForTask unit test (252 total) | maxConcurrentRuns (default 3, FIFO beyond); per-task mode resolution replaces the mutable gateway.mode; action-centric session replay (scrubber + stored per-step patches + file lens, read-only); presence glow on tree/task rows from change events (no polling); ⌘K over projects/tasks/files/actions. One unidentified flake in one full run (never reproduced across 3 subsequent runs; logs now retained per run) |
| 10. Recovery and diagnostics | NOT_STARTED | | |
| 11. Security and quality hardening | NOT_STARTED | | |
| 12. Packaging and Stable release | NOT_STARTED | | |
