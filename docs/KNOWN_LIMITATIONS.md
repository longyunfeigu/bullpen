# Known limitations — Charter 1.0.0-beta.3

This is an unsigned public preview, not the signed Stable release defined by the original V1.0
release gates.

## Installation and updates

- macOS and Windows artifacts are unsigned and not notarized. Gatekeeper, SmartScreen, Smart App
  Control, enterprise policy, or antivirus software may warn or refuse to launch them.
- Charter does not ask users to disable operating-system security globally. If the local policy does
  not permit the artifact, build from source or wait for a signed release.
- Updates are manual. Download the next GitHub Release, verify `SHA256SUMS.txt`, quit Charter, retain a
  backup of the application-data directory, and replace the application.
- There is no automatic downgrade. A database backup is created before a schema migration; restoring
  an older app may require restoring its matching database backup.
- macOS preview artifacts target Apple Silicon (`arm64`). Windows targets `x64`; Linux Preview targets
  `x64` and is distributed as a tarball.
- Exact byte-for-byte reproduction of compressed installers across operating-system images is not yet
  claimed. Dependencies are pinned and every published byte has a recorded SHA-256 digest.

## Provider and Agent limits

- Managed-provider authentication supports API keys. OAuth provider login is not implemented.
- `validateCredential` confirms that a credential exists locally; the first real provider request is
  the authoritative live validation and error classification path.
- Real-provider E2E requires the owner's API key and is not part of the public, credential-free CI
  run. Deterministic mock-runtime flows exercise the same Tool Gateway and review machinery.
- `get_symbols` and `get_diagnostics` are not registered as managed Agent tools. The editor's language
  intelligence remains available to the user.
- Python intelligence depends on a compatible language server installed on the machine; otherwise the
  UI presents installation guidance.
- External Claude Code and Codex sessions use the external CLI's permission and network model rather
  than Charter's managed Tool Gateway policy.

## Product and release limits

- No telemetry or crash-report transport ships in this build.
- Automatic Beta/Stable update channels are deferred until signed distribution is available. The beta
  channel consists of versioned GitHub prereleases plus machine-readable manifests and checksums.
- The fixed real-model 20-task evaluation and paid signing/notarization gates remain open; therefore
  this build must not be described as Stable.
