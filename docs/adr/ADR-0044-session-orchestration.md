# ADR-0044: Session orchestration — terminal.* tools, per-terminal identity door, grow-in-place command UI

- Status: Accepted (product owner decisions, 2026-07-21: grow-in-place direction over a dedicated
  fleet page; fusion-mockup details — 44px child rows, numeric needs badges, two-column tiles, both
  pause granularities; director-stage defaults — commander-room only, snapshot lookback, auto mode
  default; M12 ships first, this lands as the M13 track)

  three-tier token analysis).

## Context

Charter already treats terminals and external CLI sessions as first-class citizens: node-pty
terminals with agent-CLI detection (ADR-0017), OSC 133 semantic command marks with real exit codes
(ADR-0021), external claude/codex sessions rendered as rooms whose center column is the live
terminal (ADR-0030), a grouped session rail (ADR-0023), a Tool Gateway with an R0–R4 permission
engine and command classifier, and a durable ledger (tool_calls / permission_requests /
permission_decisions) that replay renders.

The feature: one agent session (the **orchestrator** — either the managed runtime or an external
CLI such as claude running in a Charter terminal) can open and direct sibling **worker** sessions.
Six primitive capabilities: list sessions, read output, inject input, create a session, wait for
completion, close. Canonical user stories: "try approaches A/B/C in three windows, adopt whichever
goes green"; "hand my plan to a codex window for review and argue it out, cap three rounds"; "un-stick
a session stuck on a confirmation prompt".

Reference study: FanBox v2.7 ships this as six local-HTTP endpoints plus a claude skill. Its
docs/12 analyzes three token tiers (loopback-only → token file → per-launch in-memory token) and
its pragmatics (bracketed paste, \n→\r, long-poll wait, autorun settle) are adopted here. What we
deliberately do differently: **per-terminal tokens carry caller identity** (FanBox's single shared
token cannot answer "who commanded whom"), **safety rules are enforced by the Permission Engine**
(FanBox relies on skill prose), and **every action lands in the ledger** (FanBox flashes ⚡ for 8s
and keeps no attribution).

The UI direction went through three mockup rounds. A dedicated "fleet page" was rejected (it
competes with the rail and mission control as a second center). The approved shape grows inside the
existing shell: rail family tree + commander-room fleet section (fusion mockup) with a
director-stage overlay (v3 mockup, built and verified by an independent design pass).

## Decision

1. **One heart, two doors.** Six tools — `terminal.list`, `terminal.read`, `terminal.send`,
   `terminal.create`, `terminal.wait`, `terminal.kill` — registered on the Tool Gateway
   (`registerTerminalTools`, same pattern as the command/write/skill families) and implemented by a
   new main-process `terminal-control-service`. The managed runtime reaches them over the existing
   agent-host path; external CLIs reach them through the local control door (decision 7). Both
   doors converge on the same `ToolGateway.executeCall` — one classifier, one Permission Engine,
   one ledger. No second enforcement path exists.

2. **Risk levels.** `list` R0; `wait` R0; `read` R1 (sibling output may contain secrets);
   `create` R2; `kill` R3. `send` is dynamic: when the target's foreground is a bare shell the
   injected text IS command execution — it runs through `classifyCommand` with a floor of R2;
   when the target is a TUI/agent the text is content injection → R1 (the target agent's own
   permission flow still applies); control characters (e.g. ^C) → R2. The gateway's existing R4
   pre-refusal applies unchanged.

3. **Depth cap and anti-loop.** Orchestration depth is two levels (orchestrator → worker).
   `create`/`send`/`kill` from a session that is itself a worker is refused with a typed error.
   A caller can never `send`/`kill` its own terminal. Both rules are enforced host-side, never by
   skill prose.

4. **Budgets and pauses.** Per-orchestrator budgets, settings-tunable (defaults: ≤5 live workers,
   ≤30 sends/min). Two pause granularities (product-owner confirmed): per-worker "pause remote
   control" on the ⌁ band, and fleet-wide "pause all" in the fleet section. Pause queues **new**
   injections; it never interrupts a running command and never closes terminals. User keystrokes in
   a worker terminal = **takeover**: that worker's injection queue holds automatically until the
   user hands control back, at which point queued sends release in order.

5. **Identity.** Every product-spawned pty receives three env vars: `CHARTER_TERM_ID`,
   `CHARTER_CTL` (door address), `CHARTER_CTL_TOKEN` — a per-terminal random token held in an
   in-memory registry (token → terminal), regenerated every app launch, never written to disk.
   A `CHARTER_CTL_TOKEN_OVERRIDE` env exists for dev/tests only. Distinct tokens are what let every
   ledger row answer "who commanded whom".

6. **Ledger content policy.** Every call lands in `tool_calls` with caller identity (task/session
   id, or `terminal:<id>` via the door). Injected `send` text is recorded in full — it is the audit
   trail and has passed classification. `read`/`wait` record metadata only (target, line/byte
   counts, completion reason, exit code) — captured output is never persisted, because sibling
   terminals may display secrets. The per-terminal ANSI-stripped rolling buffers (~200 KB each) that
   back `read` are in-memory only and die with the terminal.

7. **External control door.** A Unix domain socket at `<userData>/ctl.sock` (mode 0600) speaking
   HTTP, routes mirroring the six tools, token required on every request. The door is a translator
   only: validate token → resolve caller terminal → build a ToolCallRequest → `executeCall`.
   Failure semantics: 403 bad/missing token; 404 unknown target; 409 depth/self-control refusal;
   429 over budget; 501 orchestration disabled. No TCP listener exists. Windows named-pipe
   transport is recorded as follow-up; V1 targets macOS.

8. **Instruction surfaces.** One manual, three projections: a `charter-terminal` skill in the
   managed skills store (ADR-0015) with a settings one-click install; an AGENTS.md snippet for
   codex-family CLIs; the managed runtime needs none (tool descriptions are native). The skill
   documents etiquette and pitfalls (never echo the token; regex waits match command echo; how to
   un-stick a worker's confirmation prompt) — but every safety-relevant rule is enforced host-side
   regardless of what the manual says.

9. **Approvals: one record, many entries.** A risky call creates one `permission_request`; the UI
   renders it at multiple entries — rail badge, fleet tile, worker-room card, mission-control
   "Needs you", native notification (PIVOT-013/014) — all bound to the same record. Resolving at
   any entry clears all. "Always allow for this task" materializes as a StandingRule scoped to
   (task, tool, target terminal).

10. **`wait` semantics.** Three completion modes: **command** mode via OSC 133 `D;exit`
    (ADR-0021), returning the real exit code; **quiet** mode for resident TUIs (settle window,
    reusing the field-calibrated external-session constants); **until** regex evaluated only
    against output produced after the wait began. Timeout clamp 1s–240s, default 60s. Cancellation
    rides the gateway AbortSignal: stopping the task cleanly detaches pending waiters.

11. **UI: grow-in-place, no new surface** — per the two approved mockups. Rail: two-level family
    tree, worker rows one step shorter (44px vs 56px), numeric needs badges bubbling to the
    orchestrator row, "⌁ commands N" chip. Worker room: ⌁ band naming the commander (click to
    jump), takeover state, per-worker pause. Commander room: collapsible fleet section with
    two-column live tiles, on-tile approval actions, open-room jump, pause-all. **Director stage**
    overlays the fleet section: one large live pane auto-cut by explicit priority
    (pending-approval > failure > just-finished > streaming > quiet); every cut shows a reason
    chip; lockable; auto is default with a manual mode; while an approval is pending other events
    queue (a "pending cut" chip) rather than steal the stage; the director log is a filtered ledger
    view with snapshot lookback. V1 scope: commander-room only, not global. Every new UI piece
    ships with normal/loading/empty/error/cancellation states per CLAUDE.md.

12. **Master switch.** Settings toggle "会话编排" (default ON). OFF unregisters the tool family,
    does not create the socket, and hides all orchestration UI — a one-flag circuit breaker.

## Alternatives

- **Single shared token (FanBox tier 3 as-is)**: rejected — cannot attribute "who commanded whom";
  identity is the ledger's core answer.
- **Token file on disk**: rejected per FanBox's own tier-2 analysis — readable by any local
  process, including package-manager postinstall scripts.
- **TCP localhost port**: rejected — reachable by every local process and prone to port collisions;
  a socket file adds an OS permission wall and needs no port.
- **MCP server as the door**: deferred — per-CLI configuration burden; can be added later as a thin
  proxy over the same gateway path without changing enforcement.
- **Safety by skill prose alone** (FanBox's model): rejected — enforcement belongs to the
  Permission Engine; prose is etiquette only.
- **Dedicated fleet page**: rejected in design review — a second center competing with the rail and
  mission control; superseded mockup retained as archive.
- **Headless worker ptys**: rejected — visible, user-takeoverable real tabs are a product
  principle (the user can always see and grab the wheel).

## Security and data impact

New attack surface: a local control door plus programmatic input injection into user terminals.
Mitigations: socket file permissions (0600); per-terminal in-memory tokens that die with the app;
identity on every call; a single enforcement path through the existing Permission Engine including
R4 pre-refusal and plan gates; classification of injected text; budgets and rate caps; takeover
precedence; full audit of injected text; the master switch.

Residual risks, accepted and documented: (a) any process launched **inside** a worker terminal
inherits that terminal's token — the capability boundary is the process tree, exactly as in FanBox;
the skill instructs agents never to echo or persist the token; (b) an orchestrator reads worker
output that may contain untrusted text (prompt-injection vector) — mitigated, not eliminated, by
approvals on risky follow-up actions; (c) quiet-mode completion is heuristic — a misread costs
latency, never safety.

Privacy: captured terminal output is never persisted; only injected send text (which the user may
have been asked to approve) enters the ledger.

## Migration and rollback

No schema migration: `tool_calls`/`permission_*` absorb the new call kinds; new timeline/event
kinds are additive. Rollback = master switch OFF (fully inert) or revert the commits; no data
cleanup is required beyond normal retention.

## Verification

Acceptance IDs (expanded as the M13 section of IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG):

- ORCH-001 managed-driver closed loop: create → send → wait (exit 0) → read → kill, every step
  ledgered with caller identity.
- ORCH-002 R3 injection prompts for approval; the deny path returns a typed refusal to the caller.
- ORCH-003 one approval record renders at every entry; resolving at any entry clears all.
- ORCH-004 takeover: local keystrokes hold the injection queue; hand-back releases queued sends in
  order.
- ORCH-005 pause single and pause all queue new sends and never interrupt a running command.
- ORCH-006 depth cap and self-control refusals return typed errors.
- ORCH-007 budget overruns surface as 429/typed errors and are ledgered.
- ORCH-008 door auth: missing/invalid token → 403; tokens invalid after app restart; resolved
  caller identity equals the spawning terminal.
- ORCH-009 wait modes: exit-code, quiet, until-regex (post-wait output only); task stop leaves no
  orphan waiters.
- ORCH-010 director stage: priority order honored; approval-pending queues other cuts with a
  "pending cut" chip; every cut carries a reason chip; lock and manual mode work.
- ORCH-011 replay renders ⌁ orchestration events from the ledger.
- ORCH-012 master switch OFF: tools unregistered, no socket file, UI hidden; e2e proves inert.

Security suite additions: socket permission test; token restart invalidation; external-path risk
classification parity with the internal path. Performance note: buffer memory stays capped under
N concurrent terminals (200 KB × N, N bounded by worker budget).

## Amendment (2026-07-22): observation and TUI content injection are prompt-free

Product-owner decision after first real use: the R1 approval cards on `terminal.read` and on
`terminal.send` toward a TUI target added a human round-trip to every observe/instruct step of an
orchestration loop without adding a matching safety property. Decision 2 is amended:

- `terminal.read` → **R0**. Rationale: the buffer is in-memory only, the ledger records metadata
  (never content), and the sibling screen is already visible to the user. Side effect (accepted):
  read now appears in the Ask-mode catalog, so read-only managed sessions can observe workers.
- `terminal.send` with a TUI foreground → **R0**. Rationale: the injected text is conversation
  content for another agent, which applies its own permission flow to any resulting action;
  delivery is still governed by takeover precedence, the two pause granularities, send budgets,
  and the depth/self-control preflights, and the full text still lands in the ledger.
- Unchanged: bare-shell sends keep the `classifyCommand` floor of R2 (R3/R4 escalation intact),
  control characters stay R2, `create` stays R2, `kill` stays R4, and worker/send budgets and the
  master switch are untouched.

Note on R0 semantics: R0 bypasses standing deny rules by design (as for `list`/`wait`); the
per-worker/fleet pause and takeover remain the user's blocking levers for content injection.
ORCH-002 (R3 approval + deny path) is unaffected; the e2e read-approval anchors were updated to
assert the new prompt-free behavior.
